Today we announce the [release](https://github.com/sysflow-telemetry/sysflow/issues/90) of SysFlow 0.5.0!

## What's Changed?

This is our largest release since the introduction of the processor. This release packages new features, bug fixes, many performance and documentation improvements, k8s metadata and event collection, and a new library for consuming SysFlow records!

## LibSysFlow

LibSysFlow is a [self-contained C++ library](https://sysflow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/libs.html) for creating SysFlow consumers. It defines a concise API that returns SysFlow records and manages access to the underlying telemetry driver. The main interface accepts a config object in which a callback function can be set to process SysFlow records. The config option sets optimal defaults that can be customized by the consumer.

Below is a minumum example of a SysFlow consumer that uses LibSysFlow. A more complete example can be found [here](https://github.com/sysflow-telemetry/sf-collector/tree/dev/examples/callback.cpp). The SysFlow Collector also uses LibSysFlow and serves as a [reference implementation](https://github.com/sysflow-telemetry/sf-collector/tree/dev/src/collector) for library consumers.

```cpp
// consumer-defined callback function
void process_sysflow(sysflow::SFHeader* header, sysflow::Container* cont, sysflow::Process* proc, sysflow::File* f1, sysflow::File* f2, sysflow::SysFlow* rec) {
    // your switch block here
}

// example consumer
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    SysFlowConfig* config = sysflowlibscpp::InitializeSysFlowConfig();
    config->callback = process_sysflow;
    sysflowlibscpp::SysFlowDriver *driver = new sysflowlibscpp::SysFlowDriver(config);
    driver->run();
}
```

 The library is packaged as a static (.a) library and distributed as an rpm/deb/tgz artifact with [sf-collector releases](https://github.com/sysflow-telemetry/sf-collector/releases/tag/0.5.0) (both glibc and musl flavors are available). Additionally, libsysflow performs the checks to verify that the Falco driver is loaded and outputs an exception otherwise. Consumers load the Falco libs driver prior to running their main entrypoint, following the typical entrypoint recipe/script used by Falco and the SysFlow Collector. The library also exposes a set of configurable collection modes that enables the consumer to specialize the types of collected system events and meet CPU and memory requirements.

 LibSysFlow 0.5.0 builds on [Falco Libs 0.9.0](https://github.com/falcosecurity/libs/releases/tag/0.9.0).

### Musl support

This release includes a build pipeline and [LibSysFlow packages](https://github.com/sysflow-telemetry/sf-collector/releases/tag/0.5.0) glibc and musl libc. The musl packages enables the creation of portable, static SysFlow agents without dependencies with shared libraries and external packages. We currently support x86 and are working on s390x support. Stay tuned!

## K8s Metadata and Event Collection

Starting with version 0.5.0, SysFlow records include k8s pod information and k8s events when monitoring Kubernetes environments.

## Extended SysFlow Format

To record this additional information, the SysFlow specification was extended with a `Pod` object that records pod metadata for containers, denoted by the new set of `pod.*` attributes, and a new `k8s event` type, which captures and exposes k8s events in the new set of `k8s.*` attributes.

## Policy Engine Extensions

In addition to attributes of the scalar types bool, int(64), and string, the SysFlow Processor now has attributes of type `json`, which contain structured information in form of stringified JSON records. The policy language allows access to subfields inside such JSON records via [GJSON](github.com/tidwall/gjson) jsonpath expressions. The jsonpath expression must be specified as a suffix to the attribute enclosed in square brackets. Examples of such terms are:

```yaml
sf.pod.services[0.clusterip.0]: the first cluster IP address of the first service associated with a pod
sf.ke.message[items.0.namespace]: the namespace of the first item in a KE message attribute
```

See the [GJSON path synax](https://github.com/tidwall/gjson#path-syntax) for more details. The result of applying a jsonpath expression to a json attribute is always of type string.

## Contributing

SysFlow is maturing into a fully-featured ecosystem for cloud-native telemetry and security analytics. We are an inclusive project and welcome contributions from the community! Let's grow it together!
