Today we announce the [release](https://github.com/orgs/sysflow-telemetry/projects/2) of SysFlow 0.6.0!

## What's Changed?

In this release, we added several new improvements including the addition of a CORE EBPF probe.  We also refactored the processor so that it can support new rules languages (e.g., Sigma), and use different data sources with our policy engine.   Furthermore, we bumped the falco libs to version 0.12 and driver 5.1.0 and upgraded the underlying container UBI images to 9.   More details are below.

## CORE EBPF support

This new release now support the CORE EBPF probe in the collector.  This means that for systems running kernels 5.8 or newer, you no longer need to download or compile a probe or install the kernel headers.  The CORE probe is compiled directly into the collector binary, which means no need for a driver loader script either.

To choose a driver, use the following new command line argument to the sysporter:

`-k <driver type> The driver type to load. Can be ebpf, ebpf-core, or kmod`    

It's also accessible through the Docker image using the environment variable: `DRIVER_TYPE`.  This variable is prepopulated to `ebpf` in the docker compose deployments [here](https://github.com/sysflow-telemetry/sf-deployments/blob/master/docker/config/.env.collector) but can be changed.   

With the helm chart, set the following variable in the [values.yaml](https://github.com/sysflow-telemetry/sf-deployments/blob/e146752b31398a54876571ecd34843b03c4518ac/helm/charts/sf-chart/values.yaml#L114) to the desired driver. Thanks to [Marco C.](https://github.com/Marcondiro) and the folks from Cisco for the PR submission to fix issues with the helm.  Your contributions are greatly appreciated!


## Processor Refactor and Sigma Rules Engine Implementation

We refactored the SysFlow Processor to decouple the policy engine from SysFlow so that it can be used with different data sources (e.g. Open Telemetry, auditd, etc) and use different rule languages (e.g., Sigma, falco, KQL, etc.).  Along with this refactoring, we built an experimental Sigma language interpreter into the processor.   Now you can use Sigma rules with SysFlow or create your own rule language interpreter, and data source.   The documentation on this feature isn't complete, but if you would like to implement a new rules engine, data source, or use Sigma, please reach out to us on the SysFlow slack channel.  We are excited for contributions in this area and are working on an Open Telemetry
data source option for the policy engine.  

## Docker Image upgrade to UBI 9

The docker images have all been upgraded to UBI 9 as UBI 8 will soon reach EOL.   This change will not affect most people's usage of SysFlow, but it does impact folks that use the collector on older Linux kernels with the kernel module driver.  When you use the kernel driver, you must compile it with the same gcc compiler version as the kernel it is running on.  To support all kernels, we'd have to install many old gcc compiler versions into the image.  We decided not to do that at this time as it creates security issues and image bloat.  Currently, we have gcc's 11 and 12 installed in the image which should support kernels 5 and 6.   For all kernels, we recommend using the CORE eBPF driver if it is supported (5.8+), followed by the eBPF driver (4.14+), and then finally the kernel module if the other drivers are not supported.  eBPF is more secure and does not have the same compiler issues that the kernel module does. If you require a kernel module and things are not working, please reach to us at the slack channel and we can brainstorm on a solution for your use case.
