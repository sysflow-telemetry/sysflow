SysFlow Specification
========================================

The SysFlow format lifts raw system event information into an abstraction that describes process behaviors, and their relationships with containers, files, and network. This object-relational format is highly compact, yet it provides broad visibility into container clouds. The framework includes several APIs that allow users to process SysFlow with their favorite toolkits.
